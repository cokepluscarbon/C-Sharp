##1.virtual与abstract的区别

An **abstract** function can have no functionality. You're basically saying, any child class MUST give their own version of this method, however it's too general to even try to implement in the parent class.

A **virtual** function, is basically saying look, here's the functionality that may or may not be good enough for the child class. So if it is good enough, use this method, if not, then override me, and provide your own functionality.

##3.ref, out

### ref
默认情况下，C#的方法参数传递方式都是__值传递__（Java也是值传递，也只有值传递）。你可以通过在参数前面加__ref__关键字强制参数使用__引用传递__。不管被修饰的参数是基本数据类型还是引用数据类型，任何在方法里面对该变量做出的修改都会影响到方法外该变量的值。

```c#
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int age = 123;
        Method(ref age);
        System.Console.Out.WriteLine(age); // 456
    }

    private static void Method(ref int age)
    {
        age = 456;
    }
}
```

### out
In C-style languages, it is common for functions to be able to output more than one value from a single
routine. This is accomplished using output parameters, by assigning the output values to variables that
have been passed to the method by reference. Often, the starting values of the variables that are passed by
reference are unimportant. Those values will be overwritten by the function, which may never even look at
any previous value.
It would be convenient if you could use the same convention in C#, but C# requires that variables be
initialized with a starting value before they are referenced. Although you could initialize your input
variables with meaningless values before passing them into a function that will fil them with real,
meaningful ones, this practice is at best needless and at worst confusing. However, there is a way to
circumvent the C# compiler’s insistence on initial values for input arguments.
You do this with the out keyword. When a method’s input argument is prefied with out, that method can
be passed a variable that has not been initialized. The variable is passed by reference, so any changes that
the method makes to the variable will persist when control returns from the called method. Again, you must
use the out keyword when you call the method, as well as when you defie it:
