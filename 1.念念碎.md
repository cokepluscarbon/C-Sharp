##1.virtual与abstract的区别

An **abstract** function can have no functionality. You're basically saying, any child class MUST give their own version of this method, however it's too general to even try to implement in the parent class.

A **virtual** function, is basically saying look, here's the functionality that may or may not be good enough for the child class. So if it is good enough, use this method, if not, then override me, and provide your own functionality.

##3.ref, out

### ref
As mentioned, passing variables by value is the default, but you can force value parameters to be passed by
reference. To do so, use the ref keyword. If a parameter is passed to a method, and the input argument for
that method is prefied with the ref keyword, any changes that the method makes to the variable will affect
the value of the original object.

### out
In C-style languages, it is common for functions to be able to output more than one value from a single
routine. This is accomplished using output parameters, by assigning the output values to variables that
have been passed to the method by reference. Often, the starting values of the variables that are passed by
reference are unimportant. Those values will be overwritten by the function, which may never even look at
any previous value.
It would be convenient if you could use the same convention in C#, but C# requires that variables be
initialized with a starting value before they are referenced. Although you could initialize your input
variables with meaningless values before passing them into a function that will fil them with real,
meaningful ones, this practice is at best needless and at worst confusing. However, there is a way to
circumvent the C# compiler’s insistence on initial values for input arguments.
You do this with the out keyword. When a method’s input argument is prefied with out, that method can
be passed a variable that has not been initialized. The variable is passed by reference, so any changes that
the method makes to the variable will persist when control returns from the called method. Again, you must
use the out keyword when you call the method, as well as when you defie it:
