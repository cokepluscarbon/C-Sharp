#3.Virtual Methods

In C#, functions are not virtual by default but (aside from constructors) can be explicitly declared
as virtual. This follows the C++ methodology: For performance reasons, functions are not virtual unless
indicated. In Java, by contrast, all functions are virtual.

If a method with the same signature is declared in both base and derived classes but the methods are not declared
as virtual and override, respectively, then the derived class version is said to hide the base class version.
